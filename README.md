Hello,

In 2022, I wrote a thesis investigating the effect of data breach events on a firm's value by doing an event study.
For this thesis, I evaluated the following Hypotheses:

H1. Data breach events lead to negative abnormal returns for the stock price of the affected organisation.

H2. Subsequent data breach events lead to negative abnormal returns for the stock price of the affected organisation 
    to a lesser extent compared to the initial data breach event. 

For this study, I wrote a R-code to analyse four initial data breach events and four subsequent data breach events.
In the end, I was rejected both hypotheses.
H1: the results showcased mixed results, in favor of rejecting H1. Even though H1 was rejected, the findings still suggest directional support of a negative effect of a data breach event.

H2: the results did not provide evidence, to support this hypothesis. However, some evidence might suggest that a subsequent data breach event leads to positive abnormal returns.

Nonetheless, feel free to use my code and experiment yourself. 
I used an excel file to establish several dates surrounding the data breach events.
